# Core Concepts

### How rendering works

`cozy_tui` maintains an in-memory grid of cells (one per terminal character). Every frame, each widget writes its content into this grid via `canvas.write(x, y, text, style)`. After all widgets have drawn, the grid is serialized into ANSI escape sequences and written to stdout in one shot — this prevents flickering.

### Coordinate system

All positions are in **terminal characters** (columns and rows), not pixels. `(x=0, y=0)` is the top-left corner of the terminal.

When a widget is inside a `Box`, its `x` and `y` are **relative to the box's interior** (inside the border). The widget's absolute position is computed automatically.

### Widget lifecycle

1. You create widgets and set their properties.
2. You add them to a `Box` (or directly to `App`).
3. `App.run()` starts the event loop, which repeatedly calls `render()` → each widget's `draw()` → input handling.
